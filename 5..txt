Let's practice making maps in Power BI. It looks like a long Practice Activity, but most of the steps are very short.

1. Load the "PA - Maps" spreadsheet from the PowerBIData workbook.

2. Create a Map with CountryRegionCode and then (as a second level) StateProvinceCode.

3. Add Count of "AddressID" to Size - what extra information does this tell you?

4. Click on "go to the next level in the hierarchy". Notice the dot in Argentina, South America - why do you think there is a dot there?

5. Drill back up and then click on "Expand all down one level in the hierarchy". Is the Argentina dot removed?

6. Enable the "Zoom buttons", but take "Auto zoom" off.

7. Add in City and PostalCode into the Location, and zoom in on either:

a. British Columbia, Canada (just north of Seattle, Washington),

b. London, England,

c. Paris, France, or

d. Melbourne, Australia.

8. Keep clicking on "Expand all down one level in the hierarchy" - what happens to the location of the dots?

9. Click "Category labels" to On, and zoom in and out - how useful are they to you?

10. Zoom out fully, and drill up to the Country level, and change the map to a "Filled Map".

11. Change the Default color (in Data colors), so that instead of it being one color, it uses Conditional Formatting. Change it so that it has "Diverging" colors, from blue to a dark yellow to green.

12. Click on "Expand all down one level in the hierarchy", and then a second time - what happens? And why?

13. Change it back to a "Map", and use the Data Category to categorise the Country, State, City and Postal Code fields.

14. Remove the locations, and create a Hierarchy called "Location" using CountryRegionCode, StateProvinceCode, City and PostCode. Hide the original fields, and the "Location" Hierarchy in the Location.

15. Change it back to a "Map", and switch "Heat map" to On. Click on "Expand all down one level in the hierarchy", and then a second time - what happens?

16. Change the Heat Map colors so that the 0%, 50% and 100% gradient stops are different shades of red.
