Using the "PA - CDs" spreadsheet in the "PowerBIData" workbook, please have a
go at the following activity:

1. Create a Matrix, with Year of "Date created" in the Rows well, 
"File extension" in the Columns well, and "Size" in the Values well. 
Use the "alternating rows" style.

2. Change the formatting of the "Size" in this visualization only so 
that it displays in Millions.

3. Add "Quarter" into the Rows well. Have a look at the different options in
 Visual tools - Data/Drill - Data actions.

4. Do you have a problem with seeing some of the row headers? 
Please change the Font color of the Row Header.

5. Add a second visualization, a Stacked Column Chart, with 
"File extension" in the X-Axis (or Axis) well, and "Size" 
in the Y-Axis (or Value) well.

6. Add a third visualization, an Area Chart, with Year and Quarter of 
"Date created" in the Axis well, and "Size" in the Value well. 
If you are seeing only years, click on "Expand all down one level 
in the hierarchy" to show both Year and Quarter.

7. Edit the interactions, so that when you click on the first visualization, 
it filters (not highlights) the second visualization.

8. In the first visualization, click on the year 2010, and see what happens.
