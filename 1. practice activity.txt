It's time for your first Practice Activity.

1. If you haven't already downloaded the workbook "PowerBIData", please do so.

2. Open up Power Bi, and use this workbook to "Get Data" from the spreadsheet "PA - CDs" 
(not: "CDs", but "PA - CDs". This is a special version of the CDs spreadsheet for these Practical Activities).

3. Click on the fields "File extension" and Size.

4. Save this page to your local hard drive, and publish it to the Power BI service.

Good luck. If you get stuck, then please watch the next video, when I will do this Practice Activity as well.
