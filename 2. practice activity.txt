This Practice Activity continues from Practice Activity 1. As a reminder, you got data from the spreadsheet "PA - CDs" 
(from the workbook "PowerBIData"), and added the fields "File extension" and 
Size.

In this practice activity:

1. Check the default summarization for the "Size" field.

2. Add the "Date created" field into the visualization as well. 
Put it after the "File extension" but before the "Size" field.

3. Has it created a detailed hierarchy? If so, click on "Date created" 
in the "Values" well and select "Date created" 
(instead of "Date hierarchy")

* If it hasn't, then your system may have auto date hierarchies switched off. To switch it on, 
go to File > Options and Settings > Options > Data Load (Current File) > Auto 
Date/Time.

4. Change the summarization for "Date created" to "Earliest", just for this 
visualization (don't change the default).

5. Change the default formatting of the "Date created" field so that it just shows month and year.

6. Change the font size of the visualization.

7. Change the colour of the header background.

8. Change the format of the "Size" field so that it displays in Millions of bytes.

9. Copy this visualization to create a second visualization, and alter this second visualization so that 
it has just two columns: Year of "Date created", and "Size".

10. Move the first visualization so that the center of it is half way down the page, 
and move the second visualization so that the top of the visualizations are the same.
